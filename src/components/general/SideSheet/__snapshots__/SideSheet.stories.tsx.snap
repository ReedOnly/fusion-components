          Right, and where am I gonna be? Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advise, I'll never forget it. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right. Thank you. In about thirty years. Whoa, whoa, okay. Next, please. I'm gonna ram him

          Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. He's an absolute dream. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars.
